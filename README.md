# ChitChat
ChitChat is a chatting app where a user can chat with another user. It also allows users to have Profile Images and automatically derives a username for a particular user. The app utilizes SwiftUI for the user interface, SDWebImageSwiftUI for image loading and caching, and Firebase for authentication and Firestore for storing and retrieving data.
